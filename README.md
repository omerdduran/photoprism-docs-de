This repository contains the source files of [PhotoPrism's](https://photoprism.app/) documentation for editing in human-friendly Markdown files.
They are intended to be parsed with the [Mkdocs documentation builder](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate the final HTML pages available at [docs-de.photoprism.app](https://docs-de.photoprism.app/).

Although arguably less convenient to work with than a Wiki, this Git repository enables us to easily merge pull requests and constantly improve our documentation in a transparent way.
Direct access to the source files in a revision control system is a big plus to ensure the quality of our documentation.

## Editing Content ##

At the top of each generated page is an *edit this page* link to the corresponding page on GitHub, where you can make changes (and submit pull requests with a few clicks) without needing to know Git or run anything on your system.

To make more extensive changes, fork this repository, modify the corresponding `.md` source files (or create new ones), commit the changes, push them back to your fork, and then submit a pull request to our `master` branch.

### Project Layout ###

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.

### Using Mkdocs ###

First make sure you have Docker and common development tools like `make` installed on your computer.

Then use this command in the main project directory to download and run the latest version of
[mkdocs-material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material):

```sh
make pull watch
```

Now open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in a browser to view the rendered documentation.

**The content will be updated automatically when changes are detected.**

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA) ###

After submitting your first pull request, you will automatically be asked to [accept our CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/photoprism/photoprism):

- This gives us the ability to [(re-)license all code and documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_relicensing) at any time, *almost* as if we had created it ourselves (you retain the rights to your own work, which may be different for other CLAs)
- Otherwise, we cannot accept pull requests, as this would mean that we are not able to change the license of our software and documentation at a later time, even though most of it was developed and written by us
- This may be necessary, for example, if the license is incompatible with a larger combined work, we want to remove some restrictions on the AGPL/Creative Commons license, or it turns out that someone is abusing the existing license in a way we don't yet know about
- The lack of a formal contract [would also lead to legal uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO%E2%80%93Linux_disputes) for us and all users, as some contributors could later claim that they did not intend to license their code in any way and that it was stolen
